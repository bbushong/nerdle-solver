This is my first attempt at a rust program, and I am loving it! I started learning 2/20/23, and got to chapter 5 of the official book (https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/).  That is to say, lots of things to improve and learn on.

There is a website called Nerdle (https://nerdlegame.com) which requires the user to figure out a formula using guessing. This tool will have you put in the first two guesses, and depending on what you get back as answers, will give you all possible answers to the puzzle. Enjoy, and please feel free to leave feedback. Again, this was/is a learning project.
